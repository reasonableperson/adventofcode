# advent of code 2020

These are my solutions to the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
competition. Rather than saving the input as a text file, I am writing
solutions in my browser, where the unparsed puzzle input can be acccessed as
`document.body.innerText`. The solutions can be tested by opening the relevant
`/input` URL, pressing F12, and pasting the code into the console.
